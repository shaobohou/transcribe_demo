[STITCHED] Live from NPR News in Washington, I'm Windsor Johnston. The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to block full snap food benefits this month. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports it's the latest in a confusing legal battle that leaves millions of snap recipients in limbo. And appeals court late Sunday repeated what two federal judges had already said. The Trump administration must pay the full amount of food aid that snap enrollees are entitled to. In its ruling, the court said the harm in limiting those payments would be immense, and it said the administration had quote, sat on its hands for nearly a month, refusing to prepare for a funding shortfall it knew was coming. The Agriculture Department argues that tapping a larger pot of money to make full payments would hurt other nutrition programs. The government's latest appeal to the Supreme Court comes despite moves to end the federal shutdown, which would render the snap standoff moot. Jennifer Ludden is in Pimpier News, Washington. President Trump says he wants to issue what he's calling $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue. But as NPR's Danielle Kurt Slaben reports, the Treasury Secretary says there's no formal proposal yet. President Trump on social media has twice in recent days suggested the payments for low and middle income people. However, on ABCs this week on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the money may not take the form of payments, but could simply include tax cuts already passed into law It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda.

[STITCHED] Live from NPR News in Washington, I'm Windsor Johnston. The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to block full snap food benefits this month. NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports it's the latest in a confusing legal battle that leaves millions of snap recipients in limbo. And appeals court late Sunday repeated what two federal judges had already said. The Trump administration must pay the full amount of food aid that snap enrollees are entitled to. In its ruling, the court said the harm in limiting those payments would be immense, and it said the administration had quote, sat on its hands for nearly a month, refusing to prepare for a funding shortfall it knew was coming. The Agriculture Department argues that tapping a larger pot of money to make full payments would hurt other nutrition programs. The government's latest appeal to the Supreme Court comes despite moves to end the federal shutdown, which would render the snap standoff moot. Jennifer Ludden is in Pimpier News, Washington. President Trump says he wants to issue what he's calling $2,000 dividends from tariff revenue. But as NPR's Danielle Kurt Slaben reports, the Treasury Secretary says there's no formal proposal yet. President Trump on social media has twice in recent days suggested the payments for low and middle income people. However, on ABCs this week on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the money may not take the form of payments, but could simply include tax cuts already passed into law It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda.
